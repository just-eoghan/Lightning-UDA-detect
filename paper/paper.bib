   abstract = {Object detection typically assumes that training and test data are drawn from an identical distribution, which, however, does not always hold in practice. Such a distribution mismatch will lead to a significant performance drop. In this work, we aim to improve the cross-domain robustness of object detection. We tackle the domain shift on two levels: 1) the image-level shift, such as image style, illumination, etc., and 2) the instance-level shift, such as object appearance, size, etc. We build our approach based on the recent state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN model, and design two domain adaptation components, on image level and instance level, to reduce the domain discrepancy. The two domain adaptation components are based on -divergence theory, and are implemented by learning a domain classifier in adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers on different levels are further reinforced with a consistency regularization to learn a domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model. We evaluate our newly proposed approach using multiple datasets including Cityscapes, KITTI, SIM10K, etc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for robust object detection in various domain shift scenarios.},

   abstract = {Object detection typically assumes that training and test samples are drawn from an identical distribution, which, however, does not always hold in practice. Such a distribution mismatch may lead to a significant performance drop. In this work, we present Scale-aware Domain Adaptive Faster R-CNN, a model aiming at improving the cross-domain robustness of object detection. In particular, our model improves the traditional Faster R-CNN model by tackling the domain shift on two levels: (1) the image-level shift, such as image style, illumination, etc., and (2) the instance-level shift, such as object appearance, size, etc. The two domain adaptation modules are implemented by learning domain classifiers in an adversarial training manner. Moreover, we observe that the large variance in object scales often brings a crucial challenge to cross-domain object detection. Thus, we improve our model by explicitly incorporating the object scale into adversarial training. We evaluate our proposed model on multiple cross-domain scenarios, including object detection in adverse weather, learning from synthetic data, and cross-camera adaptation, where the proposed model outperforms baselines and competing methods by a significant margin. The promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model for cross-domain object detection. The implementation of our model is available at https://github.com/yuhuayc/sa-da-faster .},
